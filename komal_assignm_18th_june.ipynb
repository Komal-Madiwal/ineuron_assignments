    "\n",
    "# Logging: The logging module is designed for more robust and structured handling of messages and events in your application. It is used for generating log files and managing log levels, making it suitable for production and long-term monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2.Output Destination:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print Statements: print statements send output directly to the console (standard output). They are visible in the terminal or command prompt where you run your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Logging: Logging allows you to direct output to various destinations, such as log files, the console, or external services. This flexibility is valuable for different use cases, including debugging, monitoring, and auditing.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3.Log Levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print Statements: print statements do not support log levels by default. Every message is treated the same way and is always displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Logging: Logging supports different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL), allowing you to categorize and filter messages based on their importance. This helps in controlling the verbosity of log output.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4.Configurability:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print Statements: print statements are simple and do not offer advanced configuration options. You can't easily change their behavior or format across different parts of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Logging: The logging module provides extensive configuration options. You can customize the log format, specify log levels for different parts of your application, and control where log messages are stored (e.g., files, external services). This configurability is essential for managing complex real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5.Long-Term Maintenance:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print Statements: Using print statements for debugging is convenient during development but is not suitable for long-term maintenance or monitoring in production environments.\n",
    "\n",
