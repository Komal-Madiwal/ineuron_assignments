    "# 1. Explain what inheritance is in object-oriented programming and why it is used.\n",
    "# In object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. The class that inherits the properties and behaviors is called the derived class or child class, and the class that is inherited from is called the base class or parent class.\n",
    "\n",

    "# following are the reasons why it is used:\n",
    "# 1.Code reuse: Inheritance allows you to reuse code from existing classes, which can save time and effort.\n",
    "# 2.Abstraction: Inheritance can be used to abstract away the details of a base class, making it easier to understand and use the derived class.\n",
    "# 3.Polymorphism: Inheritance can be used to achieve polymorphism, which allows you to treat objects of different classes in a similar way.\n",
    "# 4.Encapsulation: Inheritance can be used to encapsulate the properties and behaviors of a base class, making it easier to protect them from unauthorized access.\n",

    "\n",
    "# The \"protected\" access modifier in inheritance plays a significant role in controlling the visibility and accessibility of class members (attributes and methods) within the context of inheritance. It differs from \"private\" and \"public\" modifiers in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Public Access Modifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Significance: Public members are accessible from anywhere, both within and outside the class. They have no access restrictions, providing full visibility and access.\n",
    "# Example: In Python, all class members are public by default unless explicitly marked as private or protected.\n",
    "# Private Access Modifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Significance: Private members are not accessible from outside the class where they are defined. They are used to hide implementation details and ensure encapsulation, preventing external access.\n",
    "# Example: In Python, members can be made private by prefixing their names with a double underscore, like __private_member.\n",
    "# Protected Access Modifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Significance: Protected members are not directly accessible from outside the class where they are defined, but they can be accessed within the class itself and by its subclasses (derived classes). This promotes code reuse and allows derived classes to inherit and use the members.\n",
    "# Example: In Python, protected members are indicated using a single underscore, like _protected_member, although this is more of a naming convention than a strict access control.\n",
    "# The key significance of \"protected\" access in inheritance is that it balances the need for encapsulation and data hiding with the need for derived classes to access and build upon the functionality of the base class. By making members protected, you ensure that they are not accessed directly from outside the class, but they remain accessible within the class hierarchy.\n",
