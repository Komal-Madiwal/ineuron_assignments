    "1. What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to organize and structure software in a way that models real-world entities and their interactions. OOP is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of objects, which are instances of classes, to represent and manipulate data and behavior. The key goals of OOP include:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Abstraction: Abstraction allows developers to hide complex implementation details and focus on essential features. Classes abstract real-world entities by exposing only the relevant properties and behaviors while hiding internal details. This simplifies the design and enhances code clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit (i.e., an object). It provides data protection by controlling access to an object's data, ensuring that it is modified and accessed only through well-defined interfaces (methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Inheritance: Inheritance allows the creation of new classes (subclasses or derived classes) based on existing classes (superclasses or base classes). Subclasses inherit the attributes and methods of their superclasses and can extend or override them. This promotes code reuse and the modeling of hierarchical relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This enables more flexible and generic code that can work with objects based on their common interfaces, rather than their specific types. Polymorphism is often achieved through method overriding and interfaces."

    "2. What is an object in Python?\n",
    "In Python, an object is a fundamental concept that represents a real-world entity or concept within a software program. Objects are instances of classes, and they encapsulate both data (attributes) and the functions (methods) that operate on that data.\n",
    "To create an object, we use the () operator. For example, \n",
    "car = Car()\n",
    "The Car() function is a constructor, which is a special type of function that is used to create objects. The Car() constructor takes no arguments, so the car object has no attributes.\n",
    "We can add attributes to an object by using the . operator. For example\n",
    "car.make = \"Honda\"\n",
    "We can also call methods on an object by using the . operator. For example,\n",
    "car.drive()\n",
    "The drive() method is a function that is associated with the car object. The drive() method can be used to make the car object move."
