    "# The try and except block in Python is used to handle exceptions. An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program. Exceptions can be caused by a variety of things, such as dividing by zero, accessing a nonexistent element in a list, or opening a file that does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The try block contains the code that we want to execute. If an exception occurs in the try block, the execution of the try block is stopped and the except block is executed. The except block contains the code that we want to run to handle the exception.\n",
