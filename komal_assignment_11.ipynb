    "Q1. What is a lambda function in Python, and how does it differ from a regular function?\n",
    "A lambda function in Python is a small anonymous function. It is defined using the lambda keyword, followed by a parameter list, a colon, and an expression. The expression is evaluated and the result is returned.\n",
    "here is example :\n",
    "sub= lambda x, y: x - y\n",
    "result = sub(5, 2)  # result will be 8\n",
    "result\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "--> difference between lambda and regular function\n",
    "1.Syntax:\n",
    "-->Lambda functions are defined using the lambda keyword, followed by arguments and an expression. They have a more concise syntax.\n",
    "-->Regular functions are defined using the def keyword, followed by a name, arguments, a colon, and a block of code indented beneath. They have a more structured and explicit syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "here is example lambda function;\n",
    "add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
    "here is example of regular function\n",
    "def add(x, y):\n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "    \n",
    "2.Name:\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Lambda functions are anonymous; they don't have a name. They are typically used for short, simple operations where naming a function is unnecessary.\n",
    "-->Regular functions have names and are defined with the def keyword. They have a clear, meaningful name that describes their purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Inline vs. Block:\n",
    "\n",
    "--> functions are often used where they are defined, and they are typically not stored in variables for later use. They are inline and concise.\n",
    "-->Regular functions are defined with a block of code and can be reused multiple times by calling their name. They are not limited to a single line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Complexity:\n",
    "-->Lambda functions are suitable for simple operations with a single expression. They cannot contain statements or multiple lines of code.\n",
    "-->Regular functions can be as complex as needed, containing multiple statements, loops, conditionals, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Usage:\n",
    "->Lambda functions are commonly used for tasks like sorting, filtering, or mapping elements in data structures. They are often employed as arguments to higher-order functions like map, filter, and sorted.\n",
    "->Regular functions are used for more general-purpose tasks, and they are a fundamental part of structuring larger programs and organizing code into reusable components."

They are often used in situations where you need a small, anonymous function for a specific task, and they are particularly useful when used as arguments to higher-order functions like map, filter, and sorted. Here are some common use cases for lambda functions.\n",

    "sorted_data\n",
