    "# Avoid Single-Character Names:Except for very temporary or loop control variables, avoid using single-letter variable names like x, y, i, etc.\n",
    "# Use descriptive names that convey the purpose of the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Avoid Reserved Words: Do not use Python's reserved keywords as variable names (e.g., if, while, for, def, class, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use Plural Names for Collections:Use plural names for variables that hold collections or sequences of items. For example: students, user_list.\n",

    "# Constants:Use uppercase letters for constant variables.\n",
    "# Separate words in constant names using underscores (CONSTANT_NAME).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Private Variables:Prefix private variables with a single underscore (_). This indicates that the variable is intended to be used within the current module only and should not be accessed from outside.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Class Attributes:Prefix class attributes with a double underscore (__) to invoke name mangling, which makes the attribute name more unique to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Module-Level Variables:Use lowercase letters with underscores for module-level variables. This helps distinguish them from classes and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Function Arguments:Follow the same naming conventions as for variables when naming function arguments.\n",
